# testing-heuristics
Experiments to see if we can establish evidence of the value of testing heuristics

Many of these heuristics have been created specifically to test mobile apps. Their authors are often experienced testers. Some of these authors have kindly agreed to allow some of their materials to be incorporated. Thank you to the various [contributors](contributors.md).

The materials will be made available in various forms. We're experimenting to see which are useful. Similarly we're exploring various approaches to recording their use and usefulness.
