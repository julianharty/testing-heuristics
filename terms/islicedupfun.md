## Description
Structures are used throughout software. They're part of the design, they are used to connect elements of data, they're used layout the graphical-user-interface (GUI).
##Test Focus
Can we perceive the structures as a user of the application (users seldom consider the structure unless it's flawed). If we have access to the structure of the code (in binary and possibly source formats) we can assess the structures, for instance the class structures, data structures, etc.
