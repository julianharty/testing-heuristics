# Function
## Description
Function - what the software "does" - is often a key focus for both the project team and for the users of the app.
## Testing focus
Can we identify and exercise all the functionality? How well does the functionality suit the many and varied users? Do we know what the designers intended and can we compare their intentions with what's actually been implemented, installed and used on a mobile device? Does the functionality work well when the device is on the move? has poor connectivity? etc.?
## Test ideas
We can start with our perceptions and expectations of the functionality and test how the software behaves. Even though functionality shouldn't be affected by the context of how it's being used, there may be differences depending on factors such as the features available on the mobile device e.g. does it have a finger-print reader, a GPS, proximity sensors, etc.? What are the effects of allowing and/or denying permissions to the app?
