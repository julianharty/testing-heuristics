# Interruptions
*What was that? "Could you just...?"* Interruptions are a part of our lives, and of the lifecycles for mobile apps. They need to respond well to interruptions, preserve what the user was doing, and enable the user to continue where they left off.
## Testing focus
Test the behaviours and continuity of the app when interruptions occur.
## Test ideas
Find ways to interrupt the app, with text messages, phone calls, and other apps usurping this app.
