# Mission
I have several hopes and aims with creating this collection of heuristics for testing mobile apps. Ultimately I would like to improve the craft of testing mobile apps. This material, by itself is not sufficient, the more I write the more I realise that the work and contributions of others, both previously and in future, are vital.
## Testing focus
Here are my main aims in terms of testing heuristics:

* Can we discover ways to use particular terms and heuristics to help us test better, both individually and collectively?
* What can we learn in terms of ways they may be used unproductively? and are there practical ways we can reduce misuse and the effects of misuse?
* Can you, can we, improve the materials, terms, heuristics, etc. And - assuming we can do so - will we? how can we reduce impediments and encourage useful feedback and contributions?
## Test ideas
Experiment with using several of the terms and name notes of whether (and if so how, where, when, why, etc.) they help.
