# Mnemonics for Risk and Coverage Ideas
## Description
The following material comes from a presentation by Mike Kelly several years ago. He indicates where various heuristics apply well.

* Application Touring: FFC CUTS VIDS
* Coverage: [SFDPOT](sfdpotie.md)
* Coverage and Risk: FILBOTS
* Quality Criteria: CRUSSPIC STMPL
* Test Techniques: FDSFSCURA
* Oracles: HICCUPPS
* Session Notes: MCOASTER

### FILBOTS
Frequent, Intensive, Business Critical, Legal, Obvious, Technically Risky, Stakeholder Mandated
Model Workloads for Performance Testing by Scott Barber

### CRUSSPIC STMPL
Operational Criteria: **CRUSSPIC **
Capability, Reliability, Usability, Security, Scalability, Performance, Installability, Compatibility

Development Criteria: **STMPL **
Supportability, Testability, Maintainability, Portability, Localizability

Quality Characteristics Heuristics by James Bach
