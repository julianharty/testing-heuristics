# Kiwix Mobile Apps
Information about Kiwix is available online http://www.kiwix.org

The project includes mobile apps for Android and iOS (iPhones and iPads). We are keen to help improve these apps and hope you're willing to help test these apps too, since they're aimed at enabling people to read and use Wikipedia materials offline. The project has expanded to incorporate additional content and materials such as TED talks, Science simulations (the PhET project), and others.

All the tools and apps are freely available online and as opensource apps. See https://github.com/kiwix/ for the source code for the various projects, and your app store to download the software releases for mobile devices.
