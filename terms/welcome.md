# Testing Heuristics for Mobile Apps
Welcome to this small collection of material on testing heuristics. I hope they will inspire and enable you to try out various testing ideas and be a more effective tester, while also making the testing more enjoyable and engaging.

Much of the material is based on the work of others in the software testing community, this is as much a collection as anything else. However I hope you'll also find useful the new ideas and material I've written.

I appreciate and acknowledge the help and support of various people, Joe Reeve, Karen Johnson, Nancy Kelln, and others. I also hope you'll contribute through using this material, providing feedback, and by suggesting improvements to the ideas, materials, etc. You're welcome to contact me online and by email, etc. I hope to meet many of you in person one day too.
Thank you
