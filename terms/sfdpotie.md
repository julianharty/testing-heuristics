# SFDPOT IE Heuristic
## Description
A mature heuristic for general purpose software testing, also applies for testing mobile apps. This heuristic includes:
* [**S**tructure](structure)
* [**F**unction](function)
* [**D**ata](data)
* [**P**latform](platform)
* [**O**perations](operations)
* [**T**ime](time)
* [**I**nterface](interface) where Karen focuses on the interaction aspects.
* [**E**rror testing](error_testing)

SFDPOT IE is based on the work of James Bach who created SFDPOT and later added the [I](interface). Karen wrote about applying SFDPOT to testing mobile apps, and then followed up her article with an update that includes the [I](interface) and adds [E](error_testing) for Error testing.

Karen Johnson's article on using a combined SFDPOT IE to help test mobile apps is available online at http://karennicolejohnson.com/2012/12/applying-the-sfdpot-heuristic-to-mobile-testing-adding-i/, you'll also need her earlier article which covers the SFDPOT terms http://karennicolejohnson.com/2012/05/applying-the-sfdpot-heuristic-to-mobile-testing/
