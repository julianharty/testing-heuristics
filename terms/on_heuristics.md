# Topic On Heuristics
## Description
The concept of using heuristics to help test software has been available for over a decade. Heuristics can help us improve the practice of doing testing; yet we need to also realise they are imperfect, fallible techniques - perhaps there are more relevant and/or appropriate techniques and practices. Here we use the word *term* to describe the individual words that are represented in the various heuristic; for example:
[SPIES](spies.md) is a heuristic, the terms are:

* [**S**pecial characters](special_characters.md)
* [**P**ages and content](pages_and_content.md)
* [**I**ntegrations](integrations.md)
* [**E**rror messages](errors.md)
* [**S**pecial formats](special_formats.md)

Several heuristics have been devised to help people test mobile apps. Others are relevant. Here we have collected several of the heuristics so testers (and others) can easily use and refer to them when testing mobile apps.

We also hope to learn from your experiences, details are available in our [mission](mission.md) for these materials. Also, your [feedback](feedback.md) and [suggestions](suggestions.md) are very welcome.
## Testing focus
We would appreciate your perspectives on how using various terms and heuristics affected (a) your approach to testing mobile apps (b) the effects of using the various terms and heuristics.

Also, do you have ideas and suggestions for new terms, new collections of terms (perhaps as another heuristic), etc.?
## Test ideas
Here are some ideas to help you experiment with using heuristics to test a mobile app. If you don't have a particular app to test, please test the [kiwix mobile apps](kiwix_mobile_apps.md) to help the project team improve the app for the many people who'd appreciate Wikipedia and other content available offline on their tablet or smartphone.
## Further reading
[Mike Kelly's mnemonics for risk and coverage ideas](mnemonics_for_risk_and_coverage_ideas.md) with ideas of how and where we can usefully apply various heuristics when testing software.

James Bach's blog posts on heuristics <http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/category/heuristics> are well worth reading when you are willing to cogitate (think about) ways heuristics might usefully apply to testing software.

Karen Johnson, created a deck to help testers use heuristics, here's the article <http://karennicolejohnson.com/2012/07/testing-mnemonics-as-a-card-deck/> (which includes a link to the deck in printable format).
