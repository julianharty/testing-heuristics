# App Store
Most mobile apps are distributed via an App Store, and these are typically from the Platform providers: Google Play for Android, Apple's App Store for iOS apps, and similarly Microsoft for their App Store. While there are niche App Stores e.g. <https://f-droid.org> for Android opensource apps, they're unlikely to be relevant for your mainstream testing.
## Testing ideas
Test the app against claims, against the requirements and guidelines of the App Store.
