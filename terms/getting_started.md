# Getting Started
Here's an overview of how this material is organised and how you can get started. Heuristics comprise various topics or terms. The terms aren't ordered (AFAIK) apart from to make the heuristic e.g. `MCOASTER` rather than any other permutation of the letters such as `ACEMORST` if I order the terms alphabetically.

Here the heuristics are briefly mentioned, then you can drill down into the various concepts covered by the individual terms. Some terms are used in several heuristics, sometimes there are seemingly similar but differently named concepts where I've grouped the concept.

Your feedback and contributions are both useful and important to help me and others learn more about whether, when and how heuristics are helping (or not) with your testing for the apps you work with.
